 * to applications using SAPI automation. An application can create numerous 
 * SpVoice objects, each independent of and capable of interacting with the 
 * others. An SpVoice object, usually referred to simply as a voice, is 
 * created with default property settings so that it is ready to speak 
 * immediately.
